# Pdf_Search
Python script to search for specific words in PDF files and save the results to a CSV file. This is a work in progress and uses the following modules:
  PyPDF2
  os
  re
  pandas

I've found that several tutorials may be outdated and this uses the latest code from many packages. If you have any tips for refining the code let me know.

Thanks.
